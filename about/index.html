<h4 id="This-blog-and-me"><a href="#This-blog-and-me" class="headerlink" title="This blog and me :"></a>This blog and me :</h4><p>The primary motivation to write this blog is to document my journey and experience so that I can revisit the concepts about game developement and also help others who are in the same boat as me. I ll be writing mostly about Game Programming concepts related to Unity3D and C++. But I might also have a daily log to document interesting finding that encounter day to day.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I like to play games from a wide variety of genres and also watch anime.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I also like to cook and I want to add that, the only food I can cook without the supervision of an adult, my egg dish is very tasty IMO. So there you go I can cook a tasty omlette.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="A-little-info-about-me-and-my-work-experience"><a href="#A-little-info-about-me-and-my-work-experience" class="headerlink" title="A little info about me and my work experience :"></a>A little info about me and my work experience :</h4><p>I am an aspiring game dev who likes to work on Unity3D.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have been interested in gaming since my childhood and decided I would be a game developer when I grow up. Well things always dont go the way you want it to, and I ended up working as a web developer. But this opportunity helped me alot to understand how a real world software project is created and what it takes to finish it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With this experience I decided to puruse my interest in game development. I started that by quitting my job and started learning game development on my own. Initially I started following a youtube playlist on SDL2/ OpenGL to create a simple C++ game engine. This has been an amazing and an eye opening experience to realize the amount of knowledge one requries to build the game engines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>And later on I started working on Unity3D. I enjoyed working on that engine and quickly started to work on prototype projects to get some expereince as a Programmer. Checkout my Projects section to see the work I have been doing using Unity3D.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you find this blog useful. Thank you for reading my posts!</p>
<p>I am available for work as a Unity3D programmer, please feel free to contact me on my email address.</p>
